## How to Run the Game

1. Download the zip file of this repo and open the index.html file in a browser. 
2. Or, go here: https://sarahew1206.github.io/FEND-Arcade-Game/

## How to Play

1. Use the arrow keys to move up, down, left or right as you try to avoid the big bad beetles.
2. If you hit a beetle, you'll go back to the start.
3. If you win, you'll go back to the start to play again.
4. You can't move off the board - sorry, no escaping!

IF the person who made this game, wasn't so behind in her coursework, there might be additional functionality. Stay tuned for further additions down the road!

Cheers! :)
